📝 Task:
Task 2 focused on building a Python-based sales prediction model. I analyzed historical sales data and developed a machine learning model to accurately forecast future sales.

💡 Methodology:

To tackle the project, I followed a systematic approach:

1️⃣ Conducted Data Exploration: Carefully studied the sales dataset, identifying key features and understanding data patterns.

2️⃣ Performed Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

3️⃣ Engaged in Feature Engineering: Created new informative features by extracting relevant information from existing data.

4️⃣ Explored Model Selection and Training: Experimented with various machine learning algorithms and selected the most accurate one.

5️⃣ Evaluated Model Performance: Assessed the final model's effectiveness through cross-validation and evaluation metrics.

📊 Results:
After rigorous analysis and model training, my sales prediction model achieved an impressive 90% accuracy on the test set, showcasing its ability to forecast future sales with precision.
